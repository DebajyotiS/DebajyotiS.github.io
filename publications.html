				<h3>PC-JeDi: Diffusion for Particle Cloud Generation in High Energy Physics</h3>

					In this paper, we present a new method to efficiently generate jets in High Energy Physics called
					PC-JeDi. This method utilises score-based diffusion models in conjunction with transformers which
					are well suited to the task of generating jets as particle clouds due to their permutation
					equivariance. PC-JeDi achieves competitive performance with current state-of-the-art methods across
					several metrics that evaluate the quality of the generated jets. Although slower than other models,
					due to the large number of forward passes required by diffusion models, it is still substantially
					faster than traditional detailed simulation. Furthermore, PC-JeDi uses conditional generation to
					produce jets with a desired mass and transverse momentum for two different particles, top quarks and
					gluons

				<h3>CURTAINs Flows For Flows: Constructing Unobserved Regions with Maximum Likelihood Estimation</h3>

					Model independent techniques for constructing background data templates using generative models have
					shown great promise for use in searches for new physics processes at the LHC. We introduce a major
					improvement to the CURTAINs method by training the conditional normalizing flow between two
					side-band regions using maximum likelihood estimation instead of an optimal transport loss. The new
					training objective improves the robustness and fidelity of the transformed data and is much faster
					and easier to train. We compare the performance against the previous approach and the current state
					of the art using the LHC Olympics anomaly detection dataset, where we see a significant improvement
					in sensitivity over the original CURTAINs method. Furthermore, CURTAINsF4F requires substantially
					less computational resources to cover a large number of signal regions than other fully data driven
					approaches. When using an efficient configuration, an order of magnitude more models can be trained
					in the same time required for ten signal regions, without a significant drop in performance.

				<h3>PC-Droid: Faster diffusion and improved quality for particle cloud generation</h3>
				<p>Matthew Leigh, Debajyoti Sengupta, John Andrew Raine, Guillaume Quétant, Tobias Golling</p>
				<p>
					<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06836">arxiv:2307.06836</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Building on the success of PC-JeDi we introduce PC-Droid, a substantially improved
					diffusion model for the generation of jet particle clouds. By leveraging a new diffusion
					formulation, studying more recent integration solvers, and training on all jet types
					simultaneously, we are able to achieve state-of-the-art performance for all types of jets across
					all evaluation metrics. We study the trade-off between generation speed and quality by comparing
					two attention based architectures, as well as the potential of consistency distillation to
					reduce the number of diffusion steps. Both the faster architecture and consistency models
					demonstrate performance surpassing many competing models, with generation time up to two orders
					of magnitude faster than PC-JeDi and three orders of magnitude faster than Delphes.

				<h3>The Interplay of Machine Learning--based Resonant Anomaly Detection Methods</h3>

				</p>
				<p>
					Machine learning--based anomaly detection (AD) methods are promising tools for extending the
					coverage of searches for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). One class of AD methods that has
					received significant attention is resonant anomaly detection, where the BSM is assumed to be
					localized in at least one known variable. While there have been many methods proposed to identify
					such a BSM signal that make use of simulated or detected data in different ways, there has not yet
					been a study of the methods' complementarity. To this end, we address two questions. First, in the
					absence of any signal, do different methods pick the same events as signal-like? If not, then we can
					significantly reduce the false-positive rate by comparing different methods on the same dataset.
					Second, if there is a signal, are different methods fully correlated? Even if their maximum
					performance is the same, since we do not know how much signal is present, it may be beneficial to
					combine approaches. Using the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Olympics dataset, we provide quantitative
					answers to these questions. We find that there are significant gains possible by combining multiple
					methods, which will strengthen the search program at the LHC and beyond.

				<h3>CURTAINs for your sliding window: Constructing unobserved regions by transforming adjacent intervals
				</h3>
				<p>John Andrew Raine, Samuel Klein, Debajyoti Sengupta, Tobias Golling</p>
				<p>
					<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09470">arXiv:2203.09470</a>
				</p>
				<p>

					We propose a new model independent technique for constructing background data templates for use in
					searches for new physics processes at the LHC. This method, called CURTAINs, uses invertible neural
					networks to parametrise the distribution of side band data as a function of the resonant observable.
					The network learns a transformation to map any data point from its value of the resonant observable
					to another chosen value. Using CURTAINs, a template for the background data in the signal window is
					constructed by mapping the data from the side-bands into the signal region. We perform anomaly
					detection using the CURTAINs background template to enhance the sensitivity to new physics in a bump
					hunt. We demonstrate its performance in a sliding window search across a wide range of mass values.
					Using the LHC Olympics dataset, we demonstrate that CURTAINs matches the performance of other
					leading approaches which aim to improve the sensitivity of bump hunts, can be trained on a much
					smaller range of the invariant mass, and is fully data driven.

				<h3>The Mass-ive Issue: Anomaly Detection in Jet Physics</h3>

				</p>
				<p>

					In the hunt for new and unobserved phenomena in particle physics, attention has turned in recent
					years to using advanced machine learning techniques for model independent searches. In this paper we
					highlight the main challenge of applying anomaly detection to jet physics, where preserving an
					unbiased estimator of the jet mass remains a critical piece of any model independent search. Using
					Variational Autoencoders and multiple industry-standard anomaly detection metrics, we demonstrate
					the unavoidable nature of this problem.
