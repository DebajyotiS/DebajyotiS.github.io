							<p> Imagine someone gave you a cake. You are allowed to eat, smell, touch, taste, or do other things to the cake. Your job is to figure out what the cake is made of. For some bizarre reason, and for the purposes of this analogy, you can actually only 'see' about 5% of the cake. You can't see the rest of the cake, but you know it's there because of how it affects the cake as a whole. Oh, and the cake also seems to be expanding in size. What do you do? 
							</p>
							<p>
								This is the situation High Energy Physicists find themselves in; the observable universe being the cake (admittedly this analogy sounded better in my head). We know about 5% of the observable universe. Roughly 25% is dark matter, and 70% is dark energy [<a>How do we know dark matter exists?</a>]. For the 5% of the universe that we know about, we have a very good theory, the Standard Model of Particle Physics. The Standard Model is a very successful theory, and has been tested to a very high degree of accuracy. But we know that it is not the full picture. We know that there is more to the universe than what we can see. 
							</p>
							<p>
								At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, we smash protons together at very high energies. The protons are made of quarks and gluons. When we smash them together, we create a lot of new particles. We can measure the properties of these particles, and compare them to the predictions of the Standard Model. If we find a discrepancy, we can say that we have found evidence for a new particle. This is really difficult job, because the Standard Model is a very good theory. So far, we have not found any evidence for a new particle. The last missing piece of the Standard Model, the Higgs Boson, was discovered in 2012.
							</p>
							<p>
								Evidently, the new physics, whatever and wherever it is, is very rare. So we need to look at a lot of data to find it. Most of the data that the LHC produces pertain to the standard model. So we need to find a way to separate the standard model data from the new physics data. This is where machine learning comes in. We can use machine learning to train a model to distinguish between the two. There are broadly two ways to do this: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, we train the model using data that we know is either standard model or new physics. In unsupervised learning, we train the model using data that we know is standard model, but we don't know what the new physics data looks like, and we let the model figure it out. The latter is called anomaly detection, and is a non-trivial problem.
